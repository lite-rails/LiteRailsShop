Customer Information is never disclosed to third-party websites for retargeting purposes.

We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and provide access, except in certain limited circumstances. You may also request corrections for any inaccurate, outdated, incomplete, or misleading personal information, and we will make reasonable changes when necessary.
